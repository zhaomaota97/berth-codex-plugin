name: agentour-compiler
description: Automatically create, reconstruct, validate, fidelity-test, and publish Agentour Agents. Trigger when a user wants to invent an Agent, convert or refactor an existing Agent project, package Agents for Agentour, or upload Agents. This is the single user-facing entry; it internally uses brainstorm, grill-me, and validation stages and strictly asks only one question or choice per conversational turn.
---

# Agentour Compiler

Own the complete workflow. The user must not orchestrate skills, commands, phases, validation, or retries.

## Non-bypassable bootstrap gate

Immediately after reading this Skill, before any user-facing explanation or workflow question, run:

```bash
python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agentour_api.py" bootstrap
```

Do not say “I will use Agentour Compiler” first. Do not enter Brainstorm, inspect requirements, or ask
the Agent's purpose until the command returns `ready_for_interview: true`.

- `restart_required`: stop and ask for a new Thread.
- `platform_choice_required`: ask only the fixed platform choice, then rerun with
  `bootstrap --target-platform <test|production>`.
- `token_required`: ask only for that platform's developer token, store it, then rerun the same command.
- `blocked`: stop and report the bootstrap error.
- `ready_for_interview`: use the returned Contract, recommended model, and active Compiler Tasks.

The bootstrap transcript is the audit proof that update, identity, Contract, model probes and recovery
checks ran. Absence of this command means the workflow has not started correctly.

## Bootstrap internals: version check

The bootstrap command internally runs:

```bash
python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agentour_api.py" check-update --auto
```

If it reports `updated: true`, stop this run and tell the user to start a new Codex Thread so the newly installed Plugin code is loaded. Do not continue using the old in-memory Skill. If the network check is temporarily unavailable, warn briefly and continue; if an update is known but automatic installation fails, stop and report the installer error.

## Absolute conversation rule

Every interactive turn may ask exactly one question or request exactly one choice.

- Never combine questions, even as bullets or numbered fields.
- Never ask the user to provide several examples or decisions at once.
- If a topic needs five facts, collect them over five rounds.
- A choice may contain mutually exclusive options, but it must resolve one decision only.
- Update working files after every answer, then ask the next single highest-value question.
- Continue all unblocked inspection, implementation, and validation between questions.

## Fixed platforms

| Choice | Name | URL |
|---|---|---|
| A | 测试服 | `https://test.agentour.ai` |
| B | 正式服 | `https://agentour.ai` |

Never ask the user to type a URL. 测试服 and 正式服 always use the fixed HTTPS URLs above.

## Mandatory dual state machine

Persist non-secret progress both in `.agentour/compiler-state.json` and the selected platform's
`/v1/dev/compiler-tasks` API. Never store the token. At startup, after authentication, list active
platform tasks and reconcile them with local state by task ID, Agent ID, operation, workspace ID,
Package hash, revision, and updated time. Platform job status wins over stale local `running` state.

- If local state exists, fetch its remote task and merge newer remote job results.
- If local state is missing, search active remote tasks for the same Agent/operation. One exact match
  resumes automatically; multiple plausible matches require one choice.
- Before any Package-changing stage transition, upload a clean Package checkpoint with
  `checkpoint-package`; a new workspace may restore it with `restore-checkpoint` and verify SHA-256.
- Continue existing Validation, Build, Eval, and Publish Job IDs instead of resubmitting them.
- When source, Manifest, model, or lockfile hashes change, invalidate from the earliest affected stage.
- Mark the platform task `completed` or `cancelled` at a terminal outcome.
- Record `stage_started_at`, `stage_finished_at`, and `duration_seconds` for discovery, conversion,
  environment preparation, local validation, platform validation, remote Build, Smoke/Evals, upload,
  and publish. Report the current stage by its real name; never call the entire Compiler run “上传”.

### 1. Platform choice

The first unresolved question must be exactly:

> 请选择发布平台：A. 测试服；B. 正式服。

Record the selected name and URL.

### 2. Developer token

First inspect the selected platform's saved credential:

```bash
python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/credential_store.py" status <test|production>
```

If a token is stored, validate it immediately without asking the user. Only ask for a token when none is stored or the platform explicitly returns 401/403. After receiving a replacement, validate it and store it through `credential_store.py set <platform>`; the credential script automatically selects Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service, WSL bridging, environment variables, or a permission-restricted fallback.

Validate immediately:

```bash
AGENTOUR_TOKEN="<token>" python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agentour_api.py" \
  --platform <test|production> verify-token
```

- Never print, pass as a command-line argument, persist in the project, commit, or include the token in a report.
- If validation fails, ask one question requesting a corrected token after the user checks that platform's console.
- Do not advance until `GET /v1/dev/me` succeeds.

### 3. Model discovery

After token validation, first fetch the platform contract, then models:

```bash
AGENTOUR_TOKEN="<token>" python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agentour_api.py" \
  --platform <test|production> contract
AGENTOUR_TOKEN="<token>" python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agentour_api.py" \
  --platform <test|production> models
```

The `models` command probes every model returned by the selected platform, removes failed models from `data`, sorts usable models by platform quality rank, and returns `recommended_model`. Unless the user explicitly names a model, requests a cost ceiling, or says to prioritize economy, always use `recommended_model`: the Plugin must never silently downgrade Agent quality to save cost. Economic tradeoffs belong to the developer. Inspect `filtered_unavailable` only for diagnostics. Use the contract's Smoke schema, Node/Eve versions, canonical model IDs, ignore rules, package limit, pricing unit, and runtime semantics. Run `model-probe <model>` once more immediately before generation and never use a model that fails.

### 4. Intent and source choice

Ask exactly:

> 这次是：A. 更新已发布的 Agent；B. 重构已有项目；C. 从零创建 Agent？

If the user already clearly requested create, update, reconstruct, or continue, do not ask again.
Create the matching local and remote Compiler Task immediately.

### 5A. Update an owned Agent

Call `GET /v1/dev/packages`, then resolve the requested target with
`resolve-update-intent <target>` (`POST /v1/dev/packages/update-intents` with JSON body
`{"target":"<target>"}`); match only Packages owned by the
validated developer identity. Exact ID continues; an exact name may continue after showing its
summary; fuzzy or multiple matches require one choice. A missing match must ask whether the name is
wrong or the user intended a new Agent—never silently create. Download the active immutable baseline,
inspect the highest SemVer, verify the archive hash, and perform a three-way comparison when they
differ. Preserve unaffected behavior and create a new immutable version. Recheck model availability,
examples, approvals, deliverables, Knowledge Contract, Smoke, Evals, and fidelity instead of inheriting
old claims blindly.

### 5B. Existing Agent inventory

Inspect before asking about anything discoverable. Inventory entrypoints, Agents, prompts, skills, tools, MCP servers, sub-agents, workflows, routing, tests, examples, dependencies, environment variables, external services, files, attachments, approvals, artefacts, retries, and failures.

If multiple Agents exist, ask one scope choice:

> 检测到多个 Agent。你希望：A. 合成一个 Agent；B. 分别转换并上传全部 Agent；C. 只转换其中一部分？

- For C, the next turn asks only which Agents to include; multi-select is allowed because it resolves one scope decision.
- For A, preserve every source Agent's role, routing, workflow, tools, and boundaries in one Package.
- For B, create one Package and fidelity report per source Agent.

Generate `.agentour/conversion-inventory.json`, `.agentour/conversion-map.json`, and `.agentour/fidelity-report.json`. Mark every capability `preserved`, `adapted`, `reimplemented`, `degraded`, `unsupported`, or `removed` only with explicit authorization.

### 5C. New Agent discovery

Create `AGENT_SPEC.md` immediately. Begin with one open invitation:

> 请尽可能完整地讲讲你想做的 Agent。可以包括给谁用、解决什么问题、用户会提供什么、它要执行哪些步骤、需要连接哪些系统，以及最后交付什么；不完整也没关系，我会整理后只追问关键缺口。

Extract that answer into a field-level evidence map with values, confidence, and sources:
`user_explicit`, `source_discovered`, `platform_discovered`, `inferred`, `defaulted`, or `missing`.
Then internally apply `agentour-brainstorm` and `agentour-grill-me`, asking exactly one question per turn
only for unresolved high-impact gaps or conflicts. A mature first answer may require few or zero further
questions. Keep guided one-question interviewing for vague ideas. Safe low-risk defaults do not deserve
separate turns; approvals, side effects, truth sources, severe failure consequences, minimum input,
completion, and deliverable acceptance must be explicit when inference would be risky.

Do not implement until the spec can reproduce the intended workflow. Do not ask for a separate implementation confirmation when creation was already authorized.

### Mandatory reference-material gate

Before generating or modifying Package files, explicitly resolve whether the Agent depends on the
expert's own documents, datasets, examples, SOPs, historical cases, databases, websites, repositories,
or an existing MCP knowledge source. Never infer “no reference material” merely because the initial
idea dump did not mention it. Unless the user already supplied materials or explicitly declined, the
next highest-value single question must be:

> 这个 Agent 是否需要使用你自己的参考资料或数据？如果需要，请提供本地文件路径，或说明它们来自网页、仓库、数据库还是现有 MCP；如果不需要，直接回答“不需要”。

When local files are provided, upload them to that developer's Agentour knowledge space before Package
generation:

```bash
python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agentour_api.py" --platform <test|production> \
  upload-references <file> [<file> ...]
```

Then call `/v1/plugin/knowledge/discover`, evaluate whether to reuse, extend, compose, or create the
resulting asset, and record only the channel-neutral `knowledge` requirement in the Package. Never copy
private source content or account-specific Asset IDs into the Package. Sensitive material remains owned
by the user's knowledge space and is exposed to Runtime only through the scoped Knowledge MCP Gateway.
For changing or live data, prefer a read-only connector/MCP source instead of taking a one-time file
snapshot. Record the user's decision and uploaded source IDs in compiler state so resumed runs do not ask
again or upload duplicates.

## Package generation

Create each Package under `packages/<agent-id>/` from bundled templates with `agentour.json`, `README.md`, `RELEASE.md`, `tests/smoke.yaml`, and a complete `payload/` Eve project.

Follow the fetched Compiler Contract literally. For Contract v4 and later: put behavioral instructions
in `payload/agent/instructions.md` (never `defineAgent.system`), do not throw for missing Runtime
credentials during module import/build, pin every direct dependency to an exact version, never use
`package.json#pnpm.overrides`, and copy the audited `templates/pnpm-workspace.yaml` so native Eve
dependencies use the remote Build's exact `allowBuilds` policy.

Preserve source business rules, orchestration, tool contracts, approvals, attachment behavior, output schemas, artefacts, retry behavior, and user-visible flow. Every capability needs business-readable `runtime_ui` labels. Never expose `load skill`, internal paths, or system prompts. `waiting_approval` means paused and waiting, never running.

Before generating files, turn the approved spec into an explicit acceptance contract. Every Package
must declare `deliverable.required=true`, at least one `deliverable.formats` value, and at least two
complete executable `examples`. Every generated tool must have a Chinese business name in
`tool_ux.<tool>.zh_name`. Every approval tool must provide `title`, `purpose`, `action`, `impact`,
`risk`, and `deny_effect` under `approval_ux`. Instructions must define minimum required input,
formal `ask_question` behavior, completion criteria, honest tool-failure reporting, at most one retry
for explicit transient failures, and a useful fallback deliverable. Do not leave template placeholders.

- Price in **积分** using `pricing.amount_credits`; never describe it as RMB cents.
- Use Smoke `schema_version: 1` and only `send`, `expect_tool`, `expect_contains`, `expect_approval`, and `expect_question`.
- Missing required input must use Eve `ask_question`, producing `input_requested`.
- Check Node and pnpm before dependency work. Require Node 24; never compile Node from source.
- Generate the lockfile with `pnpm install --lockfile-only`. Do not install `node_modules` in the project merely to create the lock.
- If a local build is needed, use a Linux temporary copy or the platform-compatible container helper, then delete the temporary build directory.
- Maintain `.agentour/compiler-state.json` with contract version, publish jobs, failed Gates, repairs, and results; never include tokens.

## Automatic validation and repair

Internally apply `agentour-validator` and run:

```bash
python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate_package.py" packages/<agent-id>
```

Static validation is not sufficient. Before asking visibility or publishing, every Package must pass both commands:

```bash
python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agentour_api.py" build-test packages/<agent-id>
python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agentour_api.py" --platform <test|production> \
  validate-package packages/<agent-id>
```

`build-test` copies the Package to an isolated temporary directory, runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and `pnpm exec eve build`, then deletes the temporary dependencies. `validate-package` runs the platform's exact build and Smoke Gates without publishing or occupying a Registry version. Repair and repeat until both pass. Never use formal publish as the first real execution test.

Also generate the lockfile and run build, Smoke Tests, source tests, and relevant project tests. Fix failures narrowly and rerun until green or genuinely blocked. Never weaken valid tests.

## Fidelity for existing Agents

Build comparison cases from source tests, examples, sanitized cases, prompts, and workflows. Run the same cases against source and converted Agents when executable. Compare workflow and routing, tools and arguments, approvals, attachments, structured outputs, artefacts, normal/boundary/failure/retry/multi-turn behavior, semantic results, latency, and resources.

Bind the fidelity report to the Package SHA-256. A critical workflow, tool, approval, attachment, schema, or artefact mismatch blocks publishing regardless of total score. Repair and repeat until fidelity is as high as technically possible; disclose all remaining degradation.

## Visibility choice

After validation and fidelity work, ask exactly:

> 请选择上传方式：A. 私有；B. 公开（需要平台审核）。

For multiple Packages, first ask whether one setting applies to all or should be selected one by one. If one by one, ask one Package visibility per turn.

## Upload

Revalidate the token immediately before upload. Show one compact summary of platform, Agent IDs, versions, models, visibility, validation, fidelity, and limitations. If upload was already requested, proceed; otherwise ask one final upload confirmation.

Only after that explicit confirmation, run the paid-resource remote Build Gate. Never run it during discovery, interview, local validation, visibility selection, or while awaiting confirmation. Cached content does not consume a new E2B Build quota.

Immediately before consuming Build quota, run `build-preflight`. It must confirm the E2B service,
required Runtime Profile template, active-job capacity, hourly quota, daily quota, Node and Eve contract.
If it is not ready, preserve the task and Package checkpoint and wait; do not enter a doomed Build.

```bash
python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agentour_api.py" \
  --platform <test|production> build-preflight
python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agentour_api.py" \
  --platform <test|production> remote-build packages/<agent-id>
```

Use the structured `gates` result to repair deterministic failures. Do not retry unchanged content blindly; retry only after a repair or for the single transient retry handled by the platform. Publish only when the remote Build status is `succeeded`.

On HTTP `429`, explain that the active/daily E2B quota is exhausted and wait rather than
mutating content or looping retries. Cached Build results are valid and consume no new quota.
Cancel a superseded or user-cancelled job with `cancel-build <job-id>` and confirm its terminal
status before starting another paid Build.
If polling is interrupted or the local command times out, resume that exact paid Job with
`track-build <job-id>`; never resubmit merely because observation stopped.

```bash
AGENTOUR_TOKEN="<token>" python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agentour_api.py" \
  --platform <test|production> publish-async packages/<agent-id> \
  --visibility <private|public>
```

Follow every job. On Gate failure, fix, bump the version when required, rebuild fidelity evidence, and retry. Finish with final platform status and Package identifiers.

## Required terminal platform feedback

Maintain one continuous, redacted flight recorder throughout the run. Upload exactly one terminal
report for the run:

- If deployment eventually succeeds, upload the complete 18-section run flight recorder, including
  every temporary block, retry, recovery, and failed predecessor Job. Do not upload a separate
  blocker report for a condition that was later recovered.
- Only if the run is genuinely unable to reach deployment after the permitted repairs/retries, upload
  one detailed blocker report derived from the same recorded evidence. It must explain the last
  actionable state, exact redacted errors, attempts, Jobs, Package hashes, elapsed/stalled time, and
  why the Plugin can no longer make progress. Never replace it with a status-only summary.

Read `guides/feedback.md` in full and follow its evidence boundaries and required 18-section format.
The readable filename must be `<agent-readable-name>-<operation>-完整运行现象记录-<YYYYMMDD-HHmm>.md`.
Do not create a short/user/summary alternative. Persist evidence continuously through
`scripts/flight_recorder.py`; do not reconstruct failures, latency, Job transitions, Package hashes,
polling or unknown environment facts from memory after publishing.

Upload it with the same validated token to the selected platform:

```bash
AGENTOUR_TOKEN="<token>" python3 "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agentour_api.py" \
  --platform <test|production> feedback "<readable-run-report>.md" \
  --plugin-version "<installed manifest version>" --operation <create|reconstruct|update> \
  --agent-id <agent-id> --publish-job <job-id>
```

For a blocked terminal run, use the best available Compiler Task, Validation, Build, or Publish Job ID
as `--publish-job`. Report the feedback ID to the user. Terminal feedback upload is required, not an
optional suggestion.
